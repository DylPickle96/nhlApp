Definition of the end goal of this SPA

I want to take advantage of a frontend JS charting framework to plot the change of NHL standings over time

Currently there is no historical way to view standings data of the league, conference, division or even indiviual team data.

API THOUGHTS:

Instead of making a get request with URL params I think I'd be better off making a POST request with a data range and what type of standings they are requesting


{
    "type": "league",
    "startMonth": "Oct",
    "StartDay": "4",
    "endMonth": "Apr",
    "endDay": "5"
}

We have to modify our current stored JSON. I do not want to return the whole object as is. Rather append the wins, loses, OT, and points to a date so we can plot them over time.
